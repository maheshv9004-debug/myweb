# La Tavola — Restaurant Website

This zip contains a fully responsive single‑page restaurant site built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** in separate files.

## How to run
1. Extract the zip.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double‑click). No build tools required.

## Customize
- Replace images inside `assets/` with your real photos.
- Update menu items and prices in `index.html` (search for `<article class="card">`).
- Edit colors in `styles.css` under `:root` variables.
- Hook the reservation form to your backend/service (currently front‑end only).

## Assets
Placeholder files are included so the page loads; swap them with real images (same filenames) for best results.
